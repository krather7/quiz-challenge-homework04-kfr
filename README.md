--#USAGE--<br>
This website will demonstrate my ability to create a dynamic quiz using javascript.<br>
The user will select a start button and when they do a Timer will appear as well as a quiz question with four answers.<br>
As the user answers questions, new questions and answers will replace them until 8 questions are cycled through.<br>
The user will suffer a time plenalty if they answer the question wrong.<br>
After 8 questions, the user will recieve a score based on their time left.<br>
The user must enter their initials (no more than three characters), where their initials and score will be saved in a local storage.<br>
If the user's score is higher than the old score, their score will be saved in a High Score section of the next page.<br>
To help answer questions, the correct answers are provided in the console.<br>
In the high scores page, the user can delete the old high score themselves or select a Back button to try the quiz again.<br>
